# Trigger-Word-Detection
Construct a speech dataset and implement an algorithm for trigger word detection/keyword detection/wake word detection


* Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.  
* For this implementation, the trigger word will be "Activate." Every time it hears you say "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound.
